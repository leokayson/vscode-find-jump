Find-Jump works when you type a sequence of characters so that it can narrow down the location to where you want to jump.

![Demo gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msafi/xvsc/master/findJump/demoFiles/demo.gif)

## How to use Find-Jump

When you activate Find-Jump (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd>), you'll see a blinking red light in the status bar indicating that Find-Jump is active and is receiving your input (see gif above). Now you can start typing the characters to where you want to jump. Usually 3 to 5 characters should be enough to narrow down the location, but your own workflow may vary.

A few things to note:

* The jump character is always a single letter. Sometimes the jump character needs to be pressed with the SHIFT key, which would be indicated on the jump location like `⇧z`
* Pressing the arrow keys or the enter key will exit Find-Jump
